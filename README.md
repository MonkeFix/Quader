# TETRER

Online stacker puzzle game

## Ideas

 - Add a way to choose which player you want to get blocks from, adding a negative multiplier to attack sent
 - 2v2
 - Lines received should not be greater than lines sent

## Game Comparison (pros and cons)

### Overall (exp in all the games)

#### Pros

 - Exists

#### Cons

 - No balance changes whatsoever: same rules staying unchanged for years
 - SRS (Super Rotation System)
 - Is really hard to get into competetive scene
 - Only 4 damage tagets: even, random, backfire and eliminations

### TETR.IO

#### Pros

 - Custom skin support (via TETR.IO PLUS) (graphics and sounds)
 - Really good sound effects (attack, damage, t-spins, etc.)
 - Good attack indicator (numbers on the field)
 - Good effects
 - TETRA LEAGUE (ranked matches)
 - TETRA CHANNEL 
 - MMR is really informative when ranked is actively played
 - Good spectating support
 - Good replay support

#### Cons

 - No bots to practice with
 - Bad attack system in games with 3+ people:
   - Unbearable attack when using an opener
   - Huge spikes from all players which results in huge cheese on the board
   - Often 10+ damage taken in matter of milliseconds or vice versa zero damage taken in minutes
 - Very long useless and annoying animations/transitions: 
   - When entering Zen (countdown timer)
   - In the break between 1v1 matches in tetra league
   - Uneven lines sent and received
   - You can die easily in the first 15 seconds of the game
 - Bad keyboard interface interaction in all the places (main menu, pvp, etc.). Escape key works inconsistently
 - Lack of practice modes and overall performance info (in comparison with jstris)
 - Very slow development
 - A lot of smurfs and stupid room handling (people can just stay in B rank even though they play like high SS rank)
 - Passthrough
 - Bad music choise (at least some of them): they are really good as separate tracks, but quickly become annoying when playing often
 - Bad overall game performance (low fps on macbook pro)
 - No tutorials nor guides
 - Chat is a mess with a lot of useless info (players connected/disconnects)
