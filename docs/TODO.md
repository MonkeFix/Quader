# TODOs

## Client

 - [x] Add timers to every board action and store the times. Will be useful for the following TODOs
 - [x] ~~Change direction of the board's Y axis from (0,0) being at top left corner to bottom left corner~~
 - [x] Add "invisible" top 20 lines for cases when garbage is over the board's top border
 - [x] Fix initial Y position of the incoming pieces
 - [x] Fix rotation tests for 180 degrees rotation
 - [x] ~~Change the way pieces handle their position. Now it is handled by relative coordinates and you need to manually add offsets to them which is relatively slow~~
 - [x] Fix rendering of the pieces: render into `RenderTarget2D` on demand:
	- [x] Render the Board itself
    	- [x] Re-render all board
    	- [x] Re-render only affected cells
	- [x] Render Board Grid
	- [x] Render Queue
	- [x] Render Hold
	- [x] Render individual pieces
	- [x] Render piece ghosts
	- [x] Render damage meter
 - [x] Optimize the way Pieces calculate it's position: find nearest Y for the piece ghost only on board change, etc
 - [x] Board Serialization/Deserialization
 - [x] Move SRS tables to a JSON file
