### Cons

 - No bots to practice with
 - Bad attack system in games with 3+ people:
   - Unbearable attack when using an opener
   - Huge spikes from all players which results in huge cheese on the board
   - Often 10+ damage taken in matter of milliseconds or vice versa zero damage taken in minutes
 - Very long useless and annoying animations/transitions: 
   - When entering Zen (countdown timer)
   - In the break between 1v1 matches in tetra league
   - Uneven lines sent and received
   - You can die easily in the first 15 seconds of the game
 - Bad keyboard interface interaction in all the places (main menu, pvp, etc.). Escape key works inconsistently
 - Lack of practice modes and overall performance info (in comparison with jstris)
 - Very slow development
 - A lot of smurfs and stupid room handling (people can just stay in B rank even though they play like high SS rank)
 - Passthrough
 - Bad music choise (at least some of them): they are really good as separate tracks, but quickly become annoying when playing often
